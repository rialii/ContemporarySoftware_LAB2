## Objective
Form teams of two and develop the following GitHub action workflows.
It is important that you practice developing such workflows.

Project: workflows to implement
1. Unit Testing: Create an action that builds the project and runs unit tests
whenever code is pushed to a repository.
2. Code Linting: Develop a workflow that automatically lints code for Python (e.g.,
using the flake8 action), JavaScript, or any other language.
3. Code Coverage: Create an action that calculates code coverage and posts the
results as a comment in pull requests.
4. Code Quality Metrics: Develop an action that calculates and reports various code
quality metrics like cyclomatic complexity.
5. Performance Testing: Develop a workflow that runs performance tests and
reports back with metrics.
